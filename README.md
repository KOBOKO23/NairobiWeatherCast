🌦 NairobiWeatherCast

`NairobiWeatherCast` is a simple weather forecasting app built for educational purposes, focusing on `rainfall prediction in Nairobi`. This MVP was created as part of an `Operational Training Course` in Meteorolog to show that it’s possible to build a custom weather forecasting model using open-source tools.

---

 🎯 Project Goals

- Predict rainfall in Nairobi using historical weather data.
- Build and train a machine learning model from scratch.
- Visualize forecasts in a clean, user-friendly web interface.
- Provide a solid foundation for future expansion (temperature, APIs, etc.).

 🛠 Technologies Used

`Python` – Programming language
`Flask` – Web framework
 `pandas` – Data processing
 `matplotlib` – Data visualization
 `scikit-learn` `(or TensorFlow)` – Machine learning modeling
